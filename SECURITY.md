# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the Sorting Algorithms Benchmark project. Although the primary focus of this project is on performance benchmarking and educational demonstration of sorting algorithms, security remains an important consideration.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Handling:**  
  The benchmark accepts input only via controlled command-line arguments and console prompts. No untrusted external data is processed or stored by the application.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The project relies on standard Python libraries and well-maintained open-source packages. It is important to keep these dependencies up to date to minimize potential vulnerabilities.

- **Code Execution:**  
  The benchmark runs locally in a controlled environment. Users should run the software within secure, isolated environments (e.g., virtual environments or containers) to further mitigate risk.

- **Execution Environment:**  
  Although the project does not handle sensitive data, it is recommended to use standard security best practices, such as restricting execution permissions and reviewing third-party code, when deploying or running the benchmark.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it promptly and discreetly:

- **Reporting Method:** Open an issue on the project's GitHub repository marked as a security issue.
- **Responsible Disclosure:** Please allow a reasonable period for the maintainers to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. The maintainers are not responsible for any security issues or damages arising from the use of this software. Users assume all responsibility for running the benchmark in their own secure environment.
