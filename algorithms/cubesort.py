def cubesort(arr: list) -> list:
    """
    Cube Sort implementation (simplified placeholder).

    This algorithm demonstrates a cube-based approach to sorting:
      1. The input array is arranged into a 3D cube structure.
      2. The cube is then flattened back into a one-dimensional list.
      3. The flattened list is sorted using Python's built-in sorted() function.

    Note:
      This is a simplified placeholder. A full cubesort algorithm would involve
      more complex operations on the 3D structure (and possibly parallel processing)
      to directly sort the cube without simply flattening and then using sorted().

    Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to the use of sorted())
    Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the cube and the flattened list.

    Parameters:
      arr (list): The list of elements to sort.

    Returns:
      list: A new sorted list.
